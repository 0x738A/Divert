Divert: Windows Packet Divert
-----------------------------

This a user-mode packet diversion package for Windows Vista/7.

The basic idea is that you can redirect (divert) packets from the Windows
network stack to a user-mode application using one simple programming API.
The packets can then be modified and re-injected.

The divert package is useful for implementing user-mode packet filters,
sniffers, firewalls, tunneling, etc., etc.
